# GDSC Workshop

Welcome to the GDSC (Google Developers Student Clubs) workshop tasks repository! This repository contains implementations and notebooks for various machine learning tasks conducted during the workshop.

## Tasks Included:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Techniques and methodologies used to preprocess and clean datasets.
   
2. **Model Building**:
   - **Linear Regression**: Implementation and analysis of linear regression models.
   - **Decision Tree**: Building decision tree classifiers and regressors.
   - **Random Forest**: Ensemble learning using random forest models.
   - **Logistic Regression**: Binary classification using logistic regression.

3. **Other Machine Learning Algorithms**: Additional algorithms explored during the workshop.

## Repository Structure:

- **Data/**: Contains datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **Notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks detailing implementations and analyses for each task.
- **Scripts/**: Supplementary scripts and utilities used during the workshop.

## Final Project:

For the final project, which involves developing a news classifier using NLP and Decision Trees, please refer to the dedicated repository:

**[News Classifier Using NLP](https://github.com/Zoz-HF/News-Classifier.git)**

## Usage:

Feel free to explore the notebooks and scripts provided in this repository to understand the implementations and methodologies discussed during the GDSC workshop.
